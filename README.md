# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of this project is to describe the differences between the rates for each type of city and create a proposal so that these differences can be less and provide a better service to the users of each community.

The results obtained can be seen in the following graph, where it is denoted how the rates in the urban part are higher than in the other areas, this implies or could mean that the high demand of the users is increasing the rates, as well as understanding that in urban areas there may not be enough supply, in which case it would be pertinent to be able to test these hypotheses, if there is a high demand despite the rates, that is, sales are not taking place as planned, the rates on the side urban could be a bit more competent.

Finally, the company must do more research on how sales are in order to compare the offer and rates offered against the demand for the service.
